        * `/ytdl`: This command should be used as reply to a [supported link](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html)

        * `/leech`: This command should be used as reply to a magnetic link, a torrent link, or a direct link. [this command will SPAM the chat and send the downloads a seperate files, if there is more than one file, in the specified torrent]

        * `/leech archive`: This command should be used as reply to a magnetic link, a torrent link, or a direct link. [This command will create a .tar.gz file of the output directory, and send the files in the chat, splited into PARTS of 1024MiB each, due to Telegram limitations]

        * `/gleech`: This command should be used as reply to a magnetic link, a torrent link, or a direct link. And this will download the files from the given link or torrent and will upload to the drive using rclone.

        * [Only work with direct link for now]It is like u can add custom name as prefix of the original file name.
        Like if your file name is `gk.txt` uploaded will be what u add in `CUSTOM_FILE_NAME` + `gk.txt`

        Only works with direct link.No magnet or torrent.

        And also added custom name like...

        You have to pass link as 
        `www.download.me/gk.txt | new.txt`

        the file will be uploaded as `new.txt`."""
